To run the program we need -
 -- python interpretor with "matplotlib", "networkx" and "sys" libraries.
 -- C++ 11 compiler
First, run the "main.cpp" file using C++ 11 compiler.
Some graphs and assignment files will be generated.
On commandline, run "draw.py" with 2 commandline arguments -
 -- first argument is any assignment file
 -- second argument is the graph file for which assignment is made
Finally, output images will be formed for the graphs and their assignments.
